# Fake-News-Detection-System
The proposed solution uses a Logistic Regression algorithm, a binary classification model, to predict whether a news article is real or fake. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled news articles, with features extracted from the textual content using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization method.
